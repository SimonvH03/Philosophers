Philospher
	state: think, eat, sleep
	number: 1 - n
Fork
	state: on table, in use
	number: 1 - n
Table (Bonus)
	forkcount: forks no in use

(#forks == #philosophers == #tablespots)

...think -> eat -> sleep ->...

Output
	timestamp_in_ms N has taken a fork
	timestamp_in_ms N is eating
	timestamp_in_ms N is sleeping
	timestamp_in_ms N is thinking
	timestamp_in_ms N died

Philosophers avoid dying?

Philosophers should 'be' a thread

Protect the Forks with a mutex each (to avoid philosophers duplicating them)

Avoid data races (only read after write from different thread)
